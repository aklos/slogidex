Slogidex is an evironment for writing and executing processes inspired by the concept of gradual automation. It's pretty simple: formalize a process into discrete steps, then try to replace steps with automated scripts. If you can't, that's fine, just outlining the process can already be helpful for remembering tasks, onboarding team members, or working through harder problems.

The point of Slogidex is to make that process easier with

- A unified GUI for managing processes
- Components for defining processes; like rich text blocks, code blocks, and forms
- Embedded script execution
- Instancing and progress tracking

Whether you're doing operations, system administration, or just tinkering, there's probably something you'd like to automate or simplify.

## Supported platforms

Currently Slogidex has builds for MacOS and Ubuntu 20.04 (and other debian-based linux distros).

Windows support is coming soon (likely in the earlier Beta releases).

## Development
